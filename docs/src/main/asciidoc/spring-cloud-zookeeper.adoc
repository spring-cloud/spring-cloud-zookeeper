[[spring-cloud-zookeeper-install]]
== Install Zookeeper
See the https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperStarted.html[installation
documentation] for instructions on how to install Zookeeper.

Spring Cloud Zookeeper uses Apache Curator behind the scenes.
While Zookeeper 3.5.x is still considered "beta" by the Zookeeper development team,
the reality is that it is used in production by many users.
However, Zookeeper 3.4.x is also used in production.
Prior to Apache Curator 4.0, both versions of Zookeeper were supported via two versions of Apache Curator.
Starting with Curator 4.0 both versions of Zookeeper are supported via the same Curator libraries.

In case you are integrating with version 3.4 you need to change the Zookeeper dependency
that comes shipped with `curator`, and thus `spring-cloud-zookeeper`.
To do so simply exclude that dependency and add the 3.4.x version like shown below.

[[spring-cloud-zookeeper-discovery]]
== Service Discovery with Zookeeper

Service Discovery is one of the key tenets of a microservice based architecture. Trying to
hand-configure each client or some form of convention can be difficult to do and can be
brittle. https://curator.apache.org[Curator](A Java library for Zookeeper) provides Service
Discovery through a https://curator.apache.org/curator-x-discovery/[Service Discovery
Extension]. Spring Cloud Zookeeper uses this extension for service registration and
discovery.

=== Activating

Including a dependency on
`org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-zookeeper-discovery` enables
autoconfiguration that sets up Spring Cloud Zookeeper Discovery.

NOTE: For web functionality, you still need to include
`org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web`.

CAUTION: When working with version 3.4 of Zookeeper you need to change
the way you include the dependency as described <<spring-cloud-zookeeper-install,here>>.

=== Registering with Zookeeper

When a client registers with Zookeeper, it provides metadata (such as host and port, ID,
and name) about itself.

The following example shows a Zookeeper client:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class Application {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "Hello world";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new SpringApplicationBuilder(Application.class).web(true).run(args);
    }

}
----

NOTE: The preceding example is a normal Spring Boot application.

If Zookeeper is located somewhere other than `localhost:2181`, the configuration must
provide the location of the server, as shown in the following example:

[source,yml,indent=0]
.application.yml
----
spring:
  cloud:
    zookeeper:
      connect-string: localhost:2181
----

CAUTION: If you use <<spring-cloud-zookeeper-config,Spring Cloud Zookeeper Config>>, the
values shown in the preceding example need to be in `bootstrap.yml` instead of
`application.yml`.

The default service name, instance ID, and port (taken from the `Environment`) are
`${spring.application.name}`, the Spring Context ID, and `${server.port}`, respectively.

Having `spring-cloud-starter-zookeeper-discovery` on the classpath makes the app into both
a Zookeeper "`service`" (that is, it registers itself) and a "`client`" (that is, it can
query Zookeeper to locate other services).

If you would like to disable the Zookeeper Discovery Client, you can set
`spring.cloud.zookeeper.discovery.enabled` to `false`.

=== Using the DiscoveryClient

Spring Cloud has support for
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-cloud-netflix.adoc#spring-cloud-feign[Feign]
(a REST client builder),
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/blob/master/docs/src/main/ascii[Spring
`RestTemplate`] and
https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-commons/reference/html/#loadbalanced-webclient[Spring WebFlux], using logical service names instead of physical URLs.

You can also use the `org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.DiscoveryClient`, which
provides a simple API for discovery clients that is not specific to Netflix, as shown in
the following example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Autowired
private DiscoveryClient discoveryClient;

public String serviceUrl() {
    List<ServiceInstance> list = discoveryClient.getInstances("STORES");
    if (list != null && list.size() > 0 ) {
        return list.get(0).getUri().toString();
    }
    return null;
}
----

[[spring-cloud-zookeeper-netflix]]
== Using Spring Cloud Zookeeper with Spring Cloud Netflix Components

Spring Cloud Netflix supplies useful tools that work regardless of which `DiscoveryClient`
implementation you use. Feign, Turbine, Ribbon, and Zuul all work with Spring Cloud
Zookeeper.

=== Ribbon with Zookeeper

Spring Cloud Zookeeper provides an implementation of Ribbon's `ServerList`. When you use
the  `spring-cloud-starter-zookeeper-discovery`, Ribbon is autoconfigured to use the
`ZookeeperServerList` by default.

[[spring-cloud-zookeeper-service-registry]]
== Spring Cloud Zookeeper and Service Registry

Spring Cloud Zookeeper implements the `ServiceRegistry` interface, letting developers
register arbitrary services in a programmatic way.

The `ServiceInstanceRegistration` class offers a `builder()` method to create a
`Registration` object that can be used by the `ServiceRegistry`, as shown in the following
example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Autowired
private ZookeeperServiceRegistry serviceRegistry;

public void registerThings() {
    ZookeeperRegistration registration = ServiceInstanceRegistration.builder()
            .defaultUriSpec()
            .address("anyUrl")
            .port(10)
            .name("/a/b/c/d/anotherservice")
            .build();
    this.serviceRegistry.register(registration);
}
----

=== Instance Status

Netflix Eureka supports having instances that are `OUT_OF_SERVICE` registered with the
server. These instances are not returned as active service instances. This is useful for
behaviors such as blue/green deployments. (Note that the Curator Service Discovery recipe
does not  support this behavior.) Taking advantage of the flexible payload has let Spring
Cloud Zookeeper implement `OUT_OF_SERVICE` by updating some specific metadata and then
filtering on that metadata in the Ribbon `ZookeeperServerList`. The `ZookeeperServerList`
filters out all non-null instance statuses that do not equal `UP`. If the instance status
field is empty, it is considered to be `UP` for backwards compatibility. To change the
status of an instance, make a `POST` with `OUT_OF_SERVICE` to the `ServiceRegistry`
instance status actuator endpoint, as shown in the following example:

[source,sh,indent=0]
----
$ http POST http://localhost:8081/service-registry status=OUT_OF_SERVICE
----

NOTE: The preceding example uses the `http` command from https://httpie.org.

[[spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependencies]]
== Zookeeper Dependencies

The following topics cover how to work with Spring Cloud Zookeeper dependencies:

* <<spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependencies-using>>
* <<spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependencies-activating>>
* <<spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependencies-setting-up>>
* <<spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependencies-configuring>>

[[spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependencies-using]]
=== Using the Zookeeper Dependencies

Spring Cloud Zookeeper gives you a possibility to provide dependencies of your application
as properties. As dependencies, you can understand other applications that are registered
in Zookeeper and which you would like to call through
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-cloud-netflix.adoc#spring-cloud-feign[Feign]
(a REST client builder),
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/blob/master/docs/src/main/ascii[Spring
`RestTemplate`] and
https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-commons/reference/html/#loadbalanced-webclient[Spring WebFlux].

You can also use the Zookeeper Dependency Watchers functionality to control and monitor
the state of your dependencies.

[[spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependencies-activating]]
=== Activating Zookeeper Dependencies

Including a dependency on
`org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-zookeeper-discovery` enables
autoconfiguration that sets up Spring Cloud Zookeeper Dependencies. Even if you provide
the dependencies in your properties, you can turn off the dependencies. To do so, set the
`spring.cloud.zookeeper.dependency.enabled` property to false (it defaults to `true`).

[[spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependencies-setting-up]]
=== Setting up Zookeeper Dependencies

Consider the following example of dependency representation:

[source,yml,indent=0]
.application.yml
----
spring.application.name: yourServiceName
spring.cloud.zookeeper:
  dependencies:
    newsletter:
      path: /path/where/newsletter/has/registered/in/zookeeper
      loadBalancerType: ROUND_ROBIN
      contentTypeTemplate: application/vnd.newsletter.$version+json
      version: v1
      headers:
        header1:
            - value1
        header2:
            - value2
      required: false
      stubs: org.springframework:foo:stubs
    mailing:
      path: /path/where/mailing/has/registered/in/zookeeper
      loadBalancerType: ROUND_ROBIN
      contentTypeTemplate: application/vnd.mailing.$version+json
      version: v1
      required: true
----

The next few sections go through each part of the dependency one by one. The root property
name is `spring.cloud.zookeeper.dependencies`.

[[spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependencies-setting-up-aliases]]
==== Aliases

Below the root property you have to represent each dependency as an alias. This is due to
the constraints of Ribbon, which requires that the application ID be placed in the URL.
Consequently, you cannot pass any complex path, suchas  `/myApp/myRoute/name`). The alias
is the name you use instead of the `serviceId` for `DiscoveryClient`, `Feign`, or
`RestTemplate`.

In the previous examples, the aliases are `newsletter` and `mailing`. The following
example shows Feign usage with a `newsletter` alias:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@FeignClient("newsletter")
public interface NewsletterService {
        @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = "/newsletter")
        String getNewsletters();
}
----

==== Path

The path is represented by the `path` YAML property and is the path under which the
dependency is registered under Zookeeper. As described in the
<<spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependencies-setting-up-aliases,previous section>>, Ribbon
operates on URLs. As a result, this path is not compliant with its requirement.
That is why Spring Cloud Zookeeper maps the alias to the proper path.

==== Load Balancer Type

The load balancer type is represented by `loadBalancerType` YAML property.

If you know what kind of load-balancing strategy has to be applied when calling this
particular dependency, you can provide it in the YAML file, and it is automatically
applied. You can choose one of the following load balancing strategies:

* STICKY: Once chosen, the instance is always called.
* RANDOM: Picks an instance randomly.
* ROUND_ROBIN: Iterates over instances over and over again.

==== `Content-Type` Template and Version

The `Content-Type` template and version are represented by the `contentTypeTemplate` and
`version` YAML properties.

If you version your API in the `Content-Type` header, you do not want to add this header
to each of your requests. Also, if you want to call a new version of the API, you do not
want to roam around your code to bump up the API version. That is why you can provide a
`contentTypeTemplate` with a special `$version` placeholder. That placeholder will be filled by the value of the
`version` YAML property. Consider the following example of a `contentTypeTemplate`:

----
application/vnd.newsletter.$version+json
----

Further consider the following `version`:

----
v1
----

The combination of `contentTypeTemplate` and version results in the creation of a
`Content-Type` header for each request, as follows:

----
application/vnd.newsletter.v1+json
----

==== Default Headers

Default headers are represented by the `headers` map in YAML.

Sometimes, each call to a dependency requires setting up of some default headers. To not
do that in code, you can set them up in the YAML file, as shown in the following example
`headers` section:

[source,yml,indent=0]
----
headers:
    Accept:
        - text/html
        - application/xhtml+xml
    Cache-Control:
        - no-cache
----

That `headers` section results in adding the `Accept` and `Cache-Control` headers with
appropriate list of values in your HTTP request.

==== Required Dependencies

Required dependencies are represented by `required` property in YAML.

If one of your dependencies is required to be up when your application boots, you can set
the `required: true` property in the YAML file.

If your application cannot localize the required dependency during boot time, it throws an
exception, and the Spring Context fails to set up. In other words, your application cannot
start if the required dependency is not registered in Zookeeper.

You can read more about Spring Cloud Zookeeper Presence Checker
<<spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependency-watcher-presence-checker,later in this document>>.

==== Stubs

You can provide a colon-separated path to the JAR containing stubs of the dependency, as
shown in the following example:

`stubs: org.springframework:myApp:stubs`

where:

* `org.springframework` is the `groupId`.
* `myApp` is the `artifactId`.
* `stubs` is the classifier. (Note that `stubs` is the default value.)

Because `stubs` is the default classifier, the preceding example is equal to the following
example:

`stubs: org.springframework:myApp`

[[spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependencies-configuring]]
=== Configuring Spring Cloud Zookeeper Dependencies

You can set the following properties to enable or disable parts of Zookeeper Dependencies
functionalities:

* `spring.cloud.zookeeper.dependencies`: If you do not set this property, you cannot use
Zookeeper Dependencies.
* `spring.cloud.zookeeper.dependency.ribbon.enabled` (enabled by default): Ribbon requires
either explicit global configuration or a particular one for a dependency. By turning on
this property, runtime load balancing strategy resolution is possible, and you can use the
`loadBalancerType` section of the Zookeeper Dependencies. The configuration that needs
this property has an implementation of `LoadBalancerClient` that delegates to the
`ILoadBalancer` presented in the next bullet.
* `spring.cloud.zookeeper.dependency.ribbon.loadbalancer` (enabled by default): Thanks to
this property, the custom `ILoadBalancer` knows that the part of the URI passed to Ribbon
might actually be the alias that has to be resolved to a proper path in Zookeeper. Without
this property, you cannot register applications under nested paths.
* `spring.cloud.zookeeper.dependency.headers.enabled` (enabled by default): This property
registers a `RibbonClient` that automatically appends appropriate headers and content
types with their versions, as presented in the Dependency configuration. Without this
setting, those two parameters do not work.
* `spring.cloud.zookeeper.dependency.resttemplate.enabled` (enabled by default): When
enabled, this property modifies the request headers of a `@LoadBalanced`-annotated
`RestTemplate` such that it passes headers and content type with the version set in
dependency configuration. Without this setting, those two parameters do not work.

[[spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependency-watcher]]
== Spring Cloud Zookeeper Dependency Watcher

The Dependency Watcher mechanism lets you register listeners to your dependencies. The
functionality is, in fact, an implementation of the `Observator` pattern. When a
dependency changes, its state (to either UP or DOWN), some custom logic can be applied.

=== Activating

Spring Cloud Zookeeper Dependencies functionality needs to be enabled for you to use the
Dependency Watcher mechanism.
// TODO: How can the reader do that?

=== Registering a Listener

To register a listener, you must implement an interface called
`org.springframework.cloud.zookeeper.discovery.watcher.DependencyWatcherListener` and
register it as a bean. The interface gives you one method:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
void stateChanged(String dependencyName, DependencyState newState);
----

If you want to register a listener for a particular dependency, the `dependencyName` would
be the discriminator for your concrete implementation. `newState` provides you with
information about whether your dependency has changed to `CONNECTED` or `DISCONNECTED`.

[[spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependency-watcher-presence-checker]]
=== Using the Presence Checker

Bound with the Dependency Watcher is the functionality called Presence Checker. It lets
you provide custom behavior when your application boots, to react according to the state
of your dependencies.

The default implementation of the abstract
`org.springframework.cloud.zookeeper.discovery.watcher.presence.DependencyPresenceOnStartupVerifier`
class is the
`org.springframework.cloud.zookeeper.discovery.watcher.presence.DefaultDependencyPresenceOnStartupVerifier`,
which works in the following way.

. If the dependency is marked us `required` and is not in Zookeeper, when your application
boots, it throws an exception and shuts down.
. If the dependency is not `required`, the
`org.springframework.cloud.zookeeper.discovery.watcher.presence.LogMissingDependencyChecker`
logs that the dependency is missing at the `WARN` level.

Because the `DefaultDependencyPresenceOnStartupVerifier` is registered only when there is
no bean of type `DependencyPresenceOnStartupVerifier`, this functionality can be
overridden.

[[spring-cloud-zookeeper-config]]
== Distributed Configuration with Zookeeper

Zookeeper provides a
https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperOver.html#sc_dataModelNameSpace[hierarchical namespace]
that lets clients store arbitrary data, such as configuration data. Spring Cloud Zookeeper
Config is an alternative to the
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config[Config Server and Client].
Configuration is loaded into the Spring Environment during the special "`bootstrap`"
phase. Configuration is stored in the `/config` namespace by default. Multiple
`PropertySource` instances are created, based on the application's name and the active
profiles, to mimic the Spring Cloud Config order of resolving properties. For example, an
application with a name of `testApp` and with the `dev` profile has the following property
sources created for it:

* `config/testApp,dev`
* `config/testApp`
* `config/application,dev`
* `config/application`

The most specific property source is at the top, with the least specific at the bottom.
Properties in the `config/application` namespace apply to all applications that use
zookeeper for configuration. Properties in the `config/testApp` namespace are available
only to the instances of the service named `testApp`.

Configuration is currently read on startup of the application. Sending a HTTP `POST`
request to `/refresh` causes the configuration to be reloaded. Watching the configuration
namespace (which Zookeeper supports) is not currently implemented.

=== Activating

Including a dependency on
`org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-zookeeper-config` enables
autoconfiguration that sets up Spring Cloud Zookeeper Config.

CAUTION: When working with version 3.4 of Zookeeper you need to change
the way you include the dependency as described <<spring-cloud-zookeeper-install,here>>.

=== Customizing

Zookeeper Config may be customized by setting the following properties:

[source,yml,indent=0]
.bootstrap.yml
----
spring:
  cloud:
    zookeeper:
      config:
        enabled: true
        root: configuration
        defaultContext: apps
        profileSeparator: '::'
----

* `enabled`: Setting this value to `false` disables Zookeeper Config.
* `root`: Sets the base namespace for configuration values.
* `defaultContext`: Sets the name used by all applications.
* `profileSeparator`: Sets the value of the separator used to separate the profile name in
property sources with profiles.

=== Access Control Lists (ACLs)

You can add authentication information for Zookeeper ACLs by calling the `addAuthInfo`
method of a `CuratorFramework` bean. One way to accomplish this is to provide your own
`CuratorFramework` bean, as shown in the following example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@BoostrapConfiguration
public class CustomCuratorFrameworkConfig {

  @Bean
  public CuratorFramework curatorFramework() {
    CuratorFramework curator = new CuratorFramework();
    curator.addAuthInfo("digest", "user:password".getBytes());
    return curator;
  }

}
----
Consult
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-zookeeper/blob/master/spring-cloud-zookeeper-core/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/zookeeper/ZookeeperAutoConfiguration.java[the ZookeeperAutoConfiguration class]
to see how the `CuratorFramework` bean's default configuration.

Alternatively, you can add your credentials from a class that depends on the existing
`CuratorFramework` bean, as shown in the following example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@BoostrapConfiguration
public class DefaultCuratorFrameworkConfig {

  public ZookeeperConfig(CuratorFramework curator) {
    curator.addAuthInfo("digest", "user:password".getBytes());
  }

}
----

The creation of this bean must occur during the boostrapping phase. You can register
configuration classes to run during this phase by annotating them with
`@BootstrapConfiguration` and including them in a comma-separated list that you set as the
value of the `org.springframework.cloud.bootstrap.BootstrapConfiguration` property in the
`resources/META-INF/spring.factories` file, as shown in the following example:

.resources/META-INF/spring.factories
----
org.springframework.cloud.bootstrap.BootstrapConfiguration=\
my.project.CustomCuratorFrameworkConfig,\
my.project.DefaultCuratorFrameworkConfig
----
