This project provides Zookeeper integrations for Spring Boot applications through
autoconfiguration and binding to the Spring Environment and other Spring programming model
idioms. With a few annotations, you can quickly enable and configure the common patterns
inside your application and build large distributed systems with Zookeeper based
components. The provided patterns include Service Discovery and Configuration. The project
also provides client-side load-balancing via integration with Spring Cloud LoadBalancer.
