This project provides Zookeeper integrations for Spring Boot apps through autoconfiguration
and binding to the Spring Environment and other Spring programming model idioms. With a few
simple annotations you can quickly enable and configure the common patterns inside your
application and build large distributed systems with Zookeeper based components. The
patterns provided include Service Discovery and Configuration.
Intelligent Routing (Zuul) and Client Side Load Balancing (Ribbon), Circuit Breaker
(Hystrix) are provided by integration with Spring Cloud Netflix.


== Zookeeper overview

"ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services."

See the http://zookeeper.apache.org[Zookeeper site] for more information.  Spring Cloud Zookeeper also builds on the http://curator.apache.org[Apache Curator] project which started life at Netflix.

== Spring Cloud Zookeeper Features

* Spring Cloud `DiscoveryClient` implementation
** supports Ribbon and Zuul
* Zookeeper based `PropertySource` loaded during the 'bootstrap' phase.

== Running the sample

1. http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperStarted.html#sc_Download[Install zookeeper] (On a mac with homebrew `brew install zookeeper`).
2. http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperStarted.html#sc_InstallingSingleMode[Start zookeeper].
3. http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperStarted.html#sc_ConnectingToZooKeeper[Verify zookeeper is running].
4. Run `mvn --settings .settings.xml package` this will bring in the required spring cloud maven repositories and build
5. Run `java -jar spring-cloud-zookeeper-sample/target/spring-cloud-zookeeper-sample-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar`
6. Visit http://localhost:8080, verify that `{"serviceId":"testZookeeperApp","host":"<yourhost>","port":8080}` results
7. run `java -jar spring-cloud-zookeeper-sample/target/spring-cloud-zookeeper-sample-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=8081`
8. visit http://localhost:8080 again, verify that `{"serviceId":"testZookeeperApp","host":"<yourhost>","port":8081}` eventually shows up in the results in a round robbin fashion (may take a minute or so).

== Building

:jdkversion: 1.7

=== Basic Compile and Test

To build the source you will need to install
http://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html[Apache Maven] v3.0.6 or above and JDK {jdkversion}.

Spring Cloud uses Maven for most build-related activities, and you
should be able to get off the ground quite quickly by cloning the
project you are interested in and typing

----
$ mvn install -s .settings.xml
----

NOTE: You may need to increase the amount of memory available to Maven by setting
a `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable with the value `-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m`

The `.settings.xml` is only required the first time (or after updates
to dependencies). It is there to provide repository declarations so
that those do not need to be hard coded in the project poms.

For hints on how to build the project look in `.travis.yml` if there
is one. There should be a "script" and maybe "install" command. Also
look at the "services" section to see if any services need to be
running locally (e.g. mongo or rabbit).  Ignore the git-related bits
that you might find in "before_install" since they will be able git
credentials and you already have those.

If you need mongo, rabbit or redis, see the README in the https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/scripts[scripts
demo repository] for
instructions. For example consider using the "fig.yml" with
http://www.fig.sh/[Fig] to run them in Docker containers.

=== Documentation

The spring-cloud-build module has a "docs" profile, and if you switch
that on it will try to build asciidoc sources from
`src/main/asciidoc`. As part of that process it will look for a
`README.adoc` and process it by loading all the includes, but not
parsing or rendering it, just copying it to `${main.basedir}`
(defaults to `${basedir}`, i.e. the root of the project). If there are
any changes in the README it will then show up after a Maven build as
a modified file in the correct place. Just commit it and push the change.

=== Working with the code
If you don't have an IDE preference we would recommend that you use
http://www.springsource.com/developer/sts[Spring Tools Suite] or
http://eclipse.org[Eclipse] when working with the code. We use the
http://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2eclipe] eclipse plugin for maven support. Other IDEs and tools
should also work without issue.

==== Importing into eclipse with m2eclipse
We recommend the http://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2eclipe] eclipse plugin when working with
eclipse. If you don't already have m2eclipse installed it is available from the "eclipse
marketplace".

Once the projects are imported into Eclipse you will also need to tell m2eclipse
to use the `.settings.xml` file for the projects.  If you do not do this you may
see errors many different errors related to the POMs in the projects.
Open your Eclipse preferences, expand the Maven preferences, and select User Settings.
In the User Settings field click Browse and navigate to the Spring Cloud project you
imported selecting the `.settings.xml` file in that project.  Click Apply and then OK to
save the preference changes.

==== Importing into eclipse without m2eclipse
If you prefer not to use m2eclipse you can generate eclipse project metadata using the
following command:

[indent=0]
----
	$ mvn eclipse:eclipse
----

The generated eclipse projects can be imported by selecting `import existing projects`
from the `file` menu.

==== Adding Project Lombok Agent

Spring Cloud uses [Project
Lombok](http://projectlombok.org/features/index.html) to generate
getters and setters etc. Compiling from the command line this
shouldn't cause any problems, but in an IDE you need to add an agent
to the JVM. Full instructions can be found in the Lombok website. The
sign that you need to do this is a lot of compiler errors to do with
missing methods and fields, e.g.

[indent=0]
----
The method getInitialStatus() is undefined for the type EurekaInstanceConfigBean    EurekaDiscoveryClientConfiguration.java /spring-cloud-netflix-core/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/netflix/eureka   line 120    Java Problem

==== Importing into other IDEs
Maven is well supported by most Java IDEs. Refer to you vendor documentation.


== Contributing

Spring Cloud is released under the non-restrictive Apache 2.0 license,
and follows a very standard Github development process, using Github
tracker for issues and merging pull requests into master. If you want
to contribute even something trivial please do not hesitate, but
follow the guidelines below.

=== Sign the Contributor License Agreement
Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to sign the
https://support.springsource.com/spring_committer_signup[contributor's agreement].
Signing the contributor's agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main
repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an
author credit if we do.  Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and
given the ability to merge pull requests.

=== Code Conventions and Housekeeping
None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be
added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* Use the Spring Framework code format conventions. If you use Eclipse
  you can import formatter settings using the
  `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` file from the
  https://github.com/spring-cloud/build/tree/master/eclipse-coding-conventions.xml[Spring
  Cloud Build] project. If using IntelliJ, you can use the
  http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546[Eclipse Code Formatter
  Plugin] to import the same file.
* Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an
  `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is
  for.
* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files
  in the project)
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the .java files that you modify substantially (more
  than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements.
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current master (or
  other target branch in the main project).
* When writing a commit message please follow http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions],
  if you are fixing an existing issue please add `Fixes gh-XXXX` at the end of the commit
  message (where XXXX is the issue number).
